<p>Browsers convert markup into an internal representation called the <em><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/How_to_create_a_DOM_tree"">DOM tree</a></em>. The DOM tree contains objects for all the markup’s elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs for assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>

<p>There are four things in an accessibility tree object:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><strong>name</strong></dt>
 <dd>How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text ‘Read more’ will have ‘Read more’ as its name (more on how names are computed in the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/"" rel=""noopener"">Accessible Name and Description Computation spec</a>).</dd>
 <dt><strong>description</strong></dt>
 <dd>How do we describe this element, if we want to add anything to the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of info that table offers.</dd>
 <dt><strong>role</strong></dt>
 <dd>What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?</dd>
 <dt><strong>state</strong></dt>
 <dd>Does it have a state? Think checked/unchecked for checkboxes, or collapsed/expanded for the <code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary"">&lt;summary&gt;</a></code> element.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be <em>followed</em>, a text input can be <em>typed into</em>, etc.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A cooking recipe is a simple algorithm for humans.</li>
 <li>A sorting algorithm is often used in computer programming to explain a machine how to sort data.</li>

Alpha (alpha channel) (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Colors are represented in digital form as a collection of numbers, each representing the strength or intensity level of a given component of the color. Each of these components is called a <strong>channel</strong>. In a typical image file, the color channels describe how much red, green, and blue are used to make up the final color. To represent a color through which the background can be seen to some extent, a fourth channel is added to the color: the <strong>alpha channel</strong>. The alpha channel specifies how opaque the color is.</p>

<p>For example, the color <code>#8921F2</code> (also described as <code>rgb(137, 33, 242)</code> or <code>hsl(270, 89%, 54)</code>) is a nice shade of purple. Below you see a small box of that color in the top-left corner and a box of the <em>same</em> color but with an alpha channel set at 0.5 (50% opacity). The two boxes are drawn on top of a paragraph of text.</p>

<p>In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/method"" title=""methods: A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kind of methods: Instance Methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or Static Methods which are tasks that can be performed without the need of an object instance."">methods</a>, <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/property"" title=""properties: The term property can have several meanings depending on the context.

<ul>
 <li>The <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia"">getUserMedia</a> API can be used to grab audio and video from a user's webcam, which can then be used in any way the developer likes, for example, recording video and audio, broadcasting it to another user in a conference call, or capturing image stills from the video.</li>
 <li>The <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation"">Geolocation API</a> can be used to retrieve location information from whatever service the user has available on their device (e.g. GPS), which can then be used in conjunction with the <a class=""external"" href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/"" rel=""noopener"">Google Maps APIs</a> to for example plot the user's location on a custom map and show them what tourist attractions are in their area.</li>

Asynchronous (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary"">The term <strong>asynchronous</strong> refers to </span>two or more objects or events <strong>not</strong> existing or happening at the same time (<span class=""seoSummary"">or multiple related things happening without waiting for the previous one to complete).</span> In computing, the word ""asynchronous"" is used in two major contexts.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Networking and communications</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Asynchronous communication is a method of exchanging messages between two or more parties in which each party receives and processes messages whenever it's convenient or possible to do so, rather than doing so immediately upon receipt. Additionally, messages may be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, with the understanding that if a problem occurs, the recipient will request corrections or otherwise handle the situation.</p>

 <p>For humans, e-mail is an asynchronous communication method; the sender sends an email and the recipient will read and reply to the message when it's convenient to do so, rather than doing so at once. And both sides can continue to send and receive messages whenever they wish, instead of having to schedule them around each other.</p>

 <p>When software communicates asynchronously, a program may make a request for information from another piece of software (such as a server), and continue to do other things while waiting for a reply. For example, the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX"">AJAX</a> (Asynchronous JavaScript and <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML"" title=""XML: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C.

Though many programming languages support JSON, JSON is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions."">JSON</a> is usually used rather than XML in modern applications—is a mechanism that requests relatively small amounts of data from the server using <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP"" title=""HTTP: The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them. The current version of the HTTP specification is called HTTP/2."">HTTP</a>, with the result being returned when available rather than immediately.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>Software design</dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Asynchronous software design expands upon the concept by building code that allows a program to ask that a task be performed alongside the original task (or tasks), without stopping to wait for the task to complete. When the secondary task is completed, the original task is notified using an agreed-upon mechanism so that it knows the work is done, and that the result, if any, is available.</p>

 <p>There are a number of programming techniques for implementing asynchronous software. See the article <a href=""/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous"">Asynchronous JavaScript</a> for an introduction to them.</p>

Base64 (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><strong>Base64</strong> is a group of similar <a class=""external"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding"" rel=""noopener"">binary-to-text encoding</a> schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term <em>Base64</em> originates from a specific <a class=""external"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding"" rel=""noopener"">MIME content transfer encoding</a>.</p>

<p>Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII. This is to ensure that the data remain intact without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications including email via <a class=""external"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME"" rel=""noopener"">MIME</a>, and storing complex data in <a href=""/en-US/docs/XML"">XML</a>.</p>

<p>One common application of base64 encoding on the web is to encode binary data  so it can be included in a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs"">data: URL</a>.</p>

<p>In JavaScript there are two functions respectively for decoding and encoding <em>base64</em> strings:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa"">btoa()</a></code>: creates a base-64 encoded ASCII string from a ""string"" of binary data (""btoa"" should be read as ""binary to ASCII"").</li>
 <li><code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/atob"">atob()</a></code>: decodes a base64 encoded string(""atob"" should be read as ""ASCII to binary"").</li>
</ul>

<p>The algorithm used by <code>atob()</code> and <code>btoa()</code> is specified in <a class=""external"" href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648"" rel=""noopener"">RFC 4648</a>, section 4.</p>

<p>Note that <code>btoa()</code> expects to be passed binary data, and will throw an exception if the given string contains any characters whose UTF-16 representation occupies more than one byte. For more details, see the documentation for <code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/btoa"">btoa()</a></code>.</p>

<h4 id=""Encoded_size_increase"">Encoded size increase</h4>

<p>Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. So, three 8-bits bytes of the input string/binary file (3×8 bits = 24 bits) can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits (4×6 = 24 bits).</p>

<p>This means that the Base64 version of a string or file will be at most 133% the size of its source (a ~33% increase). The increase may be larger if the encoded data is small. For example, the string <code>""a""</code> with <code>length === 1</code> gets encoded to <code>""YQ==""</code> with <code>length === 4</code> — a 300% increase.</p></article>"

<p>To draw the curve, two imaginary lines are drawn, one from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> and the other from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>. The end points of the lines are then steadily moved to the next point. A third imaginary line is drawn with its starting point moving steadily on the first helper line and the end point on the second helper line. On this imaginary line a point is drawn from its starting point moving steadily to its end point. The curve this point describes is the Bézier curve. Hereʼs an animated illustration demonstrating the creation of the curve:</p>

Block cipher mode of operation (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A block cipher mode of operation, usually just called a ""mode"" in context, specifies how a block cipher should be used to encrypt or decrypt messages that are longer than the block size.</p>

<p>Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data a block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example <a class=""glossaryLink new"" href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AES"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""The definition of that term (AES) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!"">AES</a> uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a <em>mode</em>, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.</p></article>"
Boolean (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary"">In computer science, a <strong>Boolean</strong> is a logical data type that can have only the values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</span> For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else"">if statements</a>) or repeat (such as in <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for"">for loops</a>).</p>

<p>Below is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">/* JavaScript if statement */
if (<em>boolean conditional</em>) {
   // code to execute if the conditional is true
}

if (<em>boolean conditional</em>) {
  console.log(""boolean conditional resolved to true"");
} else {
  console.log(""boolean conditional resolved to false"");
}


/* JavaScript for loop */
for (<em>control variable</em>; <em>boolean conditional</em>; <em>counter</em>) {
  // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true
}

for (var i=0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
  console.log(""I print only when the boolean conditional is true"");
}
</pre>

<p>The Boolean value is named after English mathematician <a class=""external"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George Boole"" rel=""noopener"" title=""George Boole"">George Boole</a>, who pioneered the field of mathematical logic.</p>

Call stack (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>call stack</strong> is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/function"">functions</a> — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>

<ul>
 <li>When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.</li>
 <li>Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.</li>
 <li>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.</li>
 <li>If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a ""stack overflow"" error.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=""Example"">Example</h2>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function greeting() {
   // [1] Some codes here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some codes here
}
function sayHi() {
   return ""Hi!"";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some codes here
</pre>

<p>The code above would be executed like this:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Ignore all functions, until it reaches the <code>greeting()</code> function invocation.</li>
 <li>Add the <code>greeting()</code> function to the call stack list.<br/>

  <div class=""note"">
  <p>Call stack list:<br/>
   - greeting</p>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>Execute all lines of code inside the <code>greeting()</code> function.</li>
 <li>Get to the <code>sayHi()</code> function invocation.</li>
 <li>Add the <code>sayHi()</code> function to the call stack list.<br/>

  <div class=""note"">
  <p>Call stack list:<br/>
   - greeting<br/>
   - sayHi</p>
  </div>
 </li>
 <li>Execute all lines of code inside the <code>sayHi()</code> function, until reaches its end.</li>
 <li>Return execution to the line that invoked <code>sayHi()</code> and continue executing the rest of the <code>greeting()</code> function.</li>
 <li>Delete the <code>sayHi()</code> function from our call stack list.<br/>

  <div class=""note"">

 </li>
 <li>When everything inside the <code>greeting()</code> function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.</li>

  <div class=""note"">
  <p>Call stack list:<br/>
   EMPTY</p>
  </div>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>We started with an empty Call Stack, and whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack, after executing all of its codes, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. At the end, we ended up with an empty stack too.</p>

CDN (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>CDN </strong>(Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations.

<p>CDNs are used widely for delivering stylesheets and Javascript files (static assets) of libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery etc. Using CDN for those library files is preferable for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Serving libraries' static assets over CDN lowers the request burden on our own servers.</li>
 <li>Most CDNs have servers all over the globe so CDN's servers may be geographically nearer to your users than your own servers. Geographical distance affects latency proportionally.</li>

Client hints (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary""><strong>Client Hints </strong>are a set of <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers"">HTTP request header</a> fields for proactive content negotiation allowing clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences. </span><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#Client_hints"">Client Hints</a> enable automated delivery of optimized assets like the automatic negotiation of image <abbr title=""device pixel ratio"">DPR</abbr> resolution. </p>

<p>Use of client hints isn't automatic: rather, servers must announce that they support client hints. Servers announce support for Client Hints using the <code><a class=""external"" href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grigorik-http-client-hints-03#section-2.2.1"" rel=""noopener"">Accept-CH</a></code> (accept client hints) header or an equivalent HTML meta element with the <code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#Attributes"">http-equiv</a></code> attribute.</p>

<p><code>Accept-CH: <abbr title=""device pixel ratio"">DPR</abbr>, Width, Viewport-Width, Downlink</code></p>

<p>and / or</p>

<p><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=""Accept-CH"" content=""<abbr title=""device pixel ratio"">DPR</abbr>, Width, Viewport-Width, Downlink</code><code>""&gt;</code></p>

<p>When a client receives the <code>Accept-CH</code> header, if supported, it appends Client Hint headers that match the advertised field-values. For example, based on Accept-CH example above, the client could append DPR, Width, Viewport-Width, and Downlink headers to all subsequent requests. In the second example, the server gives the browser the hints by setting the Accept-CH meta tag.</p>

<p>Basically, with the Client Hints header, the developer or application can tell the browser to advertise information about itself to the server, such as the device pixel ratio, the viewport width, and the display width. The client can then give the server information about the client's environment, and the server can determine which resources to send based on that information.</p>

<h2 id=""Varying_Client_Hints"">Varying Client Hints</h2>

<p>To convey to caches that different <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#Client_hints"">Client Hints</a> may affect the response, the <code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary"">Vary</a></code> HTTP header must be used.</p>

Code splitting (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary""><strong>Code splitting </strong>is the splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.</span></p>

<p>As an application grows in complexity or is simply maintained, CSS and JavaScripts files or  bundles grow in byte size, especially as the number and size of included third-party libraries increases. To prevent the requirement of downloading ginormous files, scripts can be split into multiple smaller files. Then features required at page load can be downloaded immediately with additional scripts being <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Lazy_load"">lazy loaded</a> after the page or application is interactive, thus improving performance. While the total amount of code is the same (and perhaps even a few bytes larger), the amount of code needed during initial load can be reduced.</p>

<p>Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like <a class=""external"" href=""https://webpack.js.org/"" rel=""noopener"">Webpack</a> and <a class=""external"" href=""http://browserify.org/"" rel=""noopener"">Browserify</a> which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.</p>

These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust."">language</a> into an equivalent program of another language. A compiler is a software to execute this task. Sometimes, this task is also referred to as ""assembling"" or ""build"", which typically indiciates more than just compilation is done, e.g. packaging it in a binary format.</p>

<p>Usually, a compiler transforms a higher-level language such as C or <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Java"" title=""Java: Java is a compiled, object-oriented, highly portable programming language."">Java</a>, which humans understand, into a machine language, such as assembly, that the CPU can understand. Some compilers which translate between similar level languages are called transpilers or cross-compilers, for instance to compile from TypeScript to <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a>. Those are considered productivity tools.</p>

<p>Most Compilers work either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT). As a programmer, you usually invoke AOT compilers from a command line or your <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/IDE"" title=""IDE: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Interactive Development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

 JIT compilers are usually transparent to you, used for performance. For instance in the browser: Firefox' <a href=""/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey"">SpiderMonkey</a> JavaScript Engine has a JIT built-in that will compile JavaScript in a website to machine code while you're viewing it so it runs faster.

Control flow (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>The <em>control flow</em> is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.</p>

<p>Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. </p>

<p>For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional"" title=""conditional: A condition is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not."">conditional</a> structure or <code>if...else</code>, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:</p>

<pre>if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
</pre>

<p>A typical script in <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a> or <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/PHP"" title=""PHP: PHP (a recursive initialism for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source server-side scripting language that can be embedded into HTML to build web applications and dynamic websites."">PHP</a> (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Loop"" title=""loops: A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met in computer programming. An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some condition is checked such as, if a counter has reached a prescribed number."">loops</a> and <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function"" title=""functions: A function is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function.

Parts of a script may also be set to execute when <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Event"" title=""events: Events are assets generated by DOM elements, which can be manipulated by a Javascript code."">events</a> occur.</p>

<p>For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the <strong>Submit</strong> button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> sections, the lines <code>promptUser</code> and <code>submitForm</code> could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.</p>

Cross-site scripting (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open Web Application Security Project, XSS was the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf"" rel=""noopener"">seventh most common Web app vulnerability</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>These attacks succeed if the Web app does not employ enough validation or encoding. The user's browser cannot detect the malicious script is untrustworthy, and so gives it access to any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive site-specific information, or lets the malicious script rewrite the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML"">HTML</a> content.</p>

<p>Cross-site scripting attacks usually occur when 1) data enters a Web app through an untrusted source (most often a Web request) or 2) dynamic content is sent to a Web user without being validated for malicious content.</p>

<p>The malicious content often includes <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"">JavaScript</a>, but sometimes HTML, Flash, or any other code the browser can execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to a webpage controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.</p>

<p>XSS attacks can be put into three categories: stored (also called persistent), reflected (also called non-persistent), or DOM-based.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><strong>Stored XSS Attacks</strong></dt>
 <dd>The injected script is stored permanently on the target servers. The victim then retrieves this malicious script from the server when the browser sends a request for data.</dd>
 <dt><strong>Reflected XSS Attacks</strong></dt>
 <dd>When a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or browsing to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable website. The Web server reflects the injected script back to the user's browser, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes data sent to the server as part of the request. The browser executes the code because it assumes the response is from a ""trusted"" server which the user has already interacted with.</dd>
 <dt><strong>DOM-based XSS Attacks</strong></dt>
 <dd>The payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment (in the victim’s browser) used by the original client-side script. That is, the page itself does not change, but the client side code contained in the page runs in an unexpected manner because of the malicious modifications to the DOM environment.</dd>

<p>To be used for cryptography, a hash function must have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
 <li>quick to compute (because they are generated frequently)</li>
 <li>not invertible (each digest could come from a very large number of messages, and only brute-force can generate a message that leads to a given digest)</li>
 <li>tamper-resistant (any change to a message leads to a different digest)</li>
 <li>collision-resistant (it should be impossible to find two different messages that produce the same digest)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1 are considered broken, as attacks have been found that significantly reduce their collision resistance.</p>

Distributed Denial of Service (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p id=""Summary"">A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is an attack in which many compromised systems are made to attack a single target, in order to swamp server resources and block legitimate users.</p>

<p>Normally many persons, using many bots, attack high-profile Web <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/server"" title=""servers: A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client.  A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center.  A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a user interface to human clients."">servers</a> like banks or credit-card payment gateways. DDoS concerns computer networks and CPU resource management.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">In a typical DDoS attack, the assailant begins by exploiting a vulnerability in one computer system and making it the DDoS</span> master<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">. The attack master, also known as the botmaster, identifies and infects other vulnerable systems with m</span>alware<span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">. Eventually, the assailant instructs the controlled machines to launch an attack against a specified target. </span></p>

<p>There are two types of DDoS attacks: a network-centric attack (which overloads a service by using up bandwidth) and an application-layer attack (which overloads a service or database with application calls). The overflow of data to the target causes saturation in the target machine so that it cannot respond or responds very slowly to legitimate traffic (hence the name ""denial of service""). The infected computers' owners normally don't know that their computers have been compromised, and they also suffer loss of service.</p>

<p>A computer under an intruder's control is called a zombie or bot. A network of co-infected computers is known as a botnet or a zombie army. Both Kaspersky Labs and Symantec have identified botnets -- not spam, viruses, or worms -- as the biggest threat to Internet security.</p>

<p>The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) defines symptoms of denial-of-service attacks to include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing websites)</li>
 <li>Unavailability of a particular website</li>
 <li>Inability to access any website</li>
 <li>Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received—(this type of DoS attack is considered an email bomb)</li>
 <li>Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection</li>
 <li>Longterm denial of access to the Web or any internet services</li>

Domain sharding (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain. To enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding that limit, <strong>domain sharding</strong> splits content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience.</p>

<p>The problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection.</p>

<p>The initial response from an HTTP request is generally an HTML file listing other resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images and other media files that need to be downloaded. As browsers limit the number of active connections per domain, serving all the required resources from a single domain could be slow as assets need to be downloaded sequentially. With domain sharding, the required downloads are served from more than one domain, enabling the browser to simultaneously download needed resources. Multiple domains, however, is an anti-pattern, as DNS lookups slow initial load times.</p>

<p>HTTP2 supports unlimited concurrent requests making domain sharding an obsolete requirement when HTTP/2 is enabled.</p>

Dynamic programming language (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>dynamic programming language</strong> is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time. For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</p>

<p>This is opposed to so-called static programming languages, in which such changes are normally not possible.</p>

<div class=""note"">
<p>Note that while there is indeed a connection between this dynamic/static property of programming languages and <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing"">dynamic</a>/<a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing"">static-typing</a>, the two are far from synonymous.</p>

Endianness (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p id=""Summary""><strong>Endian</strong> and <strong>endianness</strong> (or ""byte-order"") describe how computers organize the bytes that make up numbers.</p>

<p>Each memory storage location has an index or address. Every byte can store an 8-bit number (i.e. between <code>0x00</code> and <code>0xff</code>), so you must reserve more than one byte to store a larger number. By far the most common <em>ordering</em> of multiple bytes in one number is the <strong>little-endian</strong>, which is used on all Intel processors. Little-endian means storing bytes in order of least-to-most-significant (where the least significant byte takes the first or lowest address), comparable to a common European way of writing dates (e.g., 31 December 2050).</p>

<p>Naturally, <strong>big-endian</strong> is the opposite order, comparable to an ISO date (2050-12-31). Big-endian is also often called ""network byte order"", because Internet standards usually require data to be stored big-endian, starting at the standard UNIX socket level and going all the way up to standardized Web binary data structures. Also, older Mac computers using 68000-series and PowerPC microprocessors formerly used big-endian.</p>

<p>Examples with the number <code>0x12345678</code> (i.e. 305 419 896 in decimal):</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>little-endian</em>: <code>0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12</code></li>
 <li><em>big-endian</em>: <code>0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78</code></li>

First input delay (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary""><strong>First input delay</strong> (FID) measures the time from when a user first interacts with your site (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction.</span> It is the length of time, in milliseconds, between the first user interaction on a web page and the browser’s response to that interaction. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric.</p>

<p>The time between when content is painted to the page and when all the functionality becomes responsive to human interaction often varies based on the the size and complexity of the JavaScript needing to be downloaded, parsed, and executed on the main thread, and on the device speed or lack thereof (think low end mobile devices). The longer the delay, the worse the user experience. Reducing site initialization time and eliminating<a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API""> long tasks</a> can help eliminate first input delays.</p>

First-class Function (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A programming language is said to have <strong>First-class functions</strong> when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.</p>

<h2 id=""Example_Assign_a_function_to_a_variable"">Example | Assign a function to a variable</h2>

<h3 id=""JavaScript"">JavaScript</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">const foo = function() {
   console.log(""foobar"");
}
// Invoke it using the variable
foo();
</pre>

<p>We assigned an <strong>Anonymous Function</strong> in a <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable"" title=""Variable: A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name."">Variable</a>, then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses <code>()</code> at the end.</p>

<div class=""note"">
<p><strong>Even if your function was named,</strong> you can use the variable name to invoke it. Naming it will be helpful when debugging your code. <em>But it won't affect the way we invoke it.</em></p>
</div>

<h2 id=""Example_Pass_a_function_as_an_Argument"">Example | Pass a function as an Argument</h2>

<h3 id=""JavaScript_2"">JavaScript</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function sayHello() {

}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
  console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
greeting(sayHello, ""JavaScript!"");
</pre>

<p>We are passing our <code>sayHello()</code> function as an argument to the <code>greeting()</code> function, this explains how we are treating the function as a <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<div class=""note"">
<p>The function that we pass as an argument to another function, is called a <strong><a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function"" title=""Callback function: A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action."">Callback function</a></strong>. <em><code>sayHello</code> is a Callback function.</em></p>

<h3 id=""JavaScript_3"">JavaScript</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function sayHello() {
   return function() {
      console.log(""Hello!"");
   }
}
</pre>

<p>In this example; We need to return a function from another function - <em>We can return a function because we treated function in JavaScript as a <strong>value</strong>.</em></p>

<div class=""note"">
<p>A function that returns a function is called a <strong>Higher-Order Function</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>Back to our example; Now, we need to invoke <code>sayHello</code> function and its returned <code>Anonymous Function</code>. To do so, we have two ways:</p>

<h3 id=""1-_Using_a_variable"">1- Using a variable</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">const sayHello = function() {
   return function() {
      console.log(""Hello!"");
   }
}
const myFunc = sayHello();
myFunc();
</pre>

<p>This way, it returns the <code>Hello!</code> message.</p>

<div class=""note"">
<p>You have to use another variable. If you invoked <code>sayHello</code> directly, it would return the function itself <strong>without invoking its returned function</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id=""2-_Using_double_parentheses"">2- Using double parentheses</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function sayHello() {
   return function() {
      console.log(""Hello!"");
   }
}
sayHello()();
</pre>

<p>We are using double parentheses <code>()()</code> to invoke the returned function as well.</p>

Flexbox (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Flexbox is the commonly-used name for the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/"" rel=""noopener"">CSS Flexible Box Layout Module</a>, a layout model for displaying items in a single dimension — as a row or as a column.</p>

<p>In the specification, Flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of Flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items.</p>

<p>Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.</p>

Fragmentainer (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A fragmentainer is defined in the<a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/"" rel=""noopener""> CSS Fragmentation Specification</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A box—such as a page box, column box, or region—that contains a portion (or all) of a fragmented flow. Fragmentainers can be pre-defined, or generated as needed. When breakable content would overflow a fragmentainer in the block dimension, it breaks into the next container in its fragmentation context instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fragmented contexts are found in CSS Paged Media, where the fragmentainer would be the box which defines a page. In Multiple-column Layout the fragmentainer is the column box created when columns are defined on a multicol container. In CSS Regions each Region is a fragmentainer.</p></article>"
frame rate (FPS) (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>frame rate</strong> is the the speed at which the browser is able to recalculate, layout and paint content to the display.

<p>Movies generally have a frame rate of 24 fps. They are able to have fewer frames per second because the illusion of life is created with motion blurs. When moving on a computer screen there are no motion blurs (unless you are animating an image <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS"">sprite</a> with motion blurs).</p>

<h3 id=""Different_types_of_functions"">Different types of functions</h3>

<p>An <strong>anonymous function</strong> is a function without a function name. Only function expressions can be anonymous, function declarations must have a name:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// When used as a function expression
(function () {});
// or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
() =&gt; {};
</pre>

<p>The following terms are not used in the ECMAScript language specification, they're jargon used to refer to different types of functions.</p>

<p>A <strong>named function</strong> is a function with a function name:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// Function declaration
function foo() {};
// Named function expression
(function bar() {});
// or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const foo = () =&gt; {};
</pre>

<p>An <strong>inner function</strong> is a function inside another function (<code>square</code> in this case). An <strong>outer function</strong> is a function containing a function (<code>addSquares</code> in this case):</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function addSquares(a,b) {
   function square(x) {
      return x * x;
   }
   return square(a) + square(b);
};
//Using ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const addSquares = (a,b) =&gt; {
   const square = x =&gt; x*x;
   return square(a) + square(b);
};
</pre>

<p>A <strong>recursive function</strong> is a function that calls itself. See <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion"" title=""recursion: An act of a function calling itself. Recursion is used to solve problems that contain smaller sub-problems. A recursive function can receive two inputs: a base case (ends recursion) or a recursive case (continues recursion)."">recursion</a>.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function loop(x) {
   if (x &gt;= 10)
      return;
   loop(x + 1);
};
//Using ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const loop = x =&gt; {
   if (x &gt;= 10)
      return;
   loop(x + 1);
};
</pre>

<p>An <strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions </strong>(<a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE"" title=""IIFE: An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined."">IIFE</a>) is a function that is called directly after the function is loaded into the browser’s compiler. The way to identify an IIFE is by locating the extra left and right parenthesis at the end of the function’s definition.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// Declared functions can't be called immediately this way
// Error (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)
/*
​function foo() {
    console.log('Hello Foo');
}();
*/

// Function expressions, named or anonymous, can be called immediately
(function foo() {
    console.log(""Hello Foo"");
}());

(function food() {
    console.log(""Hello Food"");
})();

(() =&gt; console.log('hello world'))();
</pre>

<p>It is along these axes that items can be aligned and justified using the properties defined in the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout"">Box Alignment specification</a>.</p>

<p>In CSS the <em>block or column axis</em> is the axis used when laying out blocks of text. If you have two paragraphs and are working in a right to left, top to bottom language they lay out one below the other, on the block axis.</p>

<p><img alt=""Diagram showing the block axis in CSS Grid Layout."" src=""https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14775/7_Block_Axis.png"" style=""height: 306px; width: 940px;""/></p>

<p>The <em>inline or row axis</em> runs across the Block Axis and is the direction along which regular text flows. These are our rows in CSS Grid Layout.</p>

<p><img alt=""Diagram showing the inline axis in CSS Grid Layout."" src=""https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14773/7_Inline_Axis.png"" style=""height: 306px; width: 940px;""/></p>

<p>The physical direction of these axes can change according to the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid,_Logical_Values_and_Writing_Modes"">writing mode</a> of the document.</p>

<p>If you do not place items using one of the grid placement methods, direct children of the grid container will be placed one into each individual grid cell by the auto-placement algorithm.

<p>In the example we have created a three column track grid. The five items are placed into grid cells working along an initial row of three grid cells, then creating a new row for the remaining two.</p>

<p>Lines can be addressed using their line number. In a left-to-right language such as English, column line 1 will be on the left of the grid, row line 1 on the top. Lines numbers respect the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Writing_Modes"">writing mode</a> of the document and so in a right-to-left language for example, column line 1 will be on the right of the grid. The image below shows the line numbers of the grid, assuming the language is left-to-right.</p>

<p>Lines are also created in the <em>implicit grid</em> when implicit tracks are created to hold content positioned outside of the <em>explicit grid</em>, however these lines cannot be addressed by a number.</p>

<p>In terms of grid sizing, gaps act as if they were a regular grid track however nothing can be placed into the gap. The gap acts as if the grid line at that location has gained extra size, so any grid item placed after that line begins at the end of the gap.</p>

<p>The grid-gap properties are not the only thing that can cause tracks to space out. Margins, padding or the use of the space distribution properties in <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout"">Box Alignment</a> can all contribute to the visible gap – therefore the grid-gap properties should not be seen as equal to “the gutter size” unless you know that your design has not introduced any additional space with one of these methods.</p>

Hoisting (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Hoisting is a term you will <em>not</em> find used in any normative specification prose prior to <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification</a>. Hoisting was thought up as a general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript. However, the concept can be a little confusing at first.</p>

<p>Conceptually, for example, a strict definition of hoisting suggests that variable and function declarations are physically moved to the top of your code, but this is not in fact what happens. Instead, the variable and function declarations are put into memory during the <em>compile</em> phase, but stay exactly where you typed them in your code.</p>

<h2 id=""Learn_more"">Learn more</h2>

<h3 id=""Technical_example"">Technical example</h3>

<p>One of the advantages of JavaScript putting function declarations into memory before it executes any code segment is that it allows you to use a function before you declare it in your code. For example:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">function catName(name) {
  console.log(""My cat's name is "" + name);
}

catName(""Tiger"");

/*
The result of the code above is: ""My cat's name is Tiger""
*/
</pre>

<p>The above code snippet is how you would expect to write the code for it to work. Now, let's see what happens when we call the function before we write it:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">catName(""Chloe"");

function catName(name) {
  console.log(""My cat's name is "" + name);
}
/*
The result of the code above is: ""My cat's name is Chloe""
*/
</pre>

<p>Even though we call the function in our code first, before the function is written, the code still works. This is because of how context execution works in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Hoisting works well with other data types and variables. The variables can be initialized and used before they are declared.</p>

<h3 id=""Only_declarations_are_hoisted"">Only declarations are hoisted</h3>

<p>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations. If a variable is declared and initialized after using it, the value will be undefined. For example:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">console.log(num); // Returns undefined, as only declaration was hoisted, no initialization has happened at this stage
var num; // declaration
num = 6; // initialization</pre>

<p>The example below only has initialization. No hoisting happens so trying to read the variable results in ReferenceError exception.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">console.log(num); // throws ReferenceError exception
num = 6; // initialization</pre>

<p>Below are more examples demonstrating hoisting.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// Example 1
// Only y is hoisted

x = 1; // Initialize x, and if not already declared, declare it - but no hoisting as there is no var in the statement.
console.log(x + "" "" + y); // '1 undefined'
//This prints value of y as undefined as JavaScript <strong>only hoists</strong> <strong>declarations</strong>
var y = 2; // Declare and Initialize y


// Example 2
// No hoisting, but since initialization also causes declaration (if not already declared), variables are available.

a = 'Cran'; //Initialize a
b = 'berry'; //Initialize b
console.log(a + """" + b); // 'Cranberry'

Houdini (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary"">Houdini is a set of low level APIs that give developers the power to extend CSS, providing the ability to hook into the styling and layout process of a browser’s rendering engine. Houdini gives developers access to the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model"">CSS Object Model</a> (<a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM"">CSSOM</a>), enabling developers to write code the browser can parse as CSS. </span>The benefit of Houdini is that developers can create CSS features without waiting for web standards specifications to define them and without waiting for every browser to fully implement the features.  </p>

<p>While many of the features Houdini enables can be created with JavaScript, interacting directly with the CSSOM before JavaScript is enabled provides for faster parse times. Browsers create the CSSOM —  including layout, paint, and composite processes — before applying any style updates found in scripts: layout, paint, and composite processes are repeated for updated JavaScript styles to be implemented. Houdini code doesn't wait for that first rendering cycle to be complete. Rather, it is included in that first cycle, creating renderable, understandable styles.</p>

The <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/IETF"" title=""IETF: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a worldwide organization that drafts specifications governing the mechanisms behind the Internet, especially the TCP/IP or Internet Protocol Suite."">IETF</a> began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995.

HTTP header (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>An <strong>HTTP header</strong> is a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional information, altering or precising the semantics of the message or of the body.

<p>HTTP/2 does not modify the application semantics of HTTP in any way. All the core concepts found in HTTP 1.1, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides application complexity within the new framing layer.

Idempotent (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>An HTTP method is <strong>idempotent</strong> if an identical request can be made once or several times in a row with the same effect while leaving the server in the same state. In other words, an idempotent method should not have any side-effects (except for keeping statistics). Implemented correctly, the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"" title=""The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.""><code>GET</code></a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD"" title=""The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that are returned if the specified resource would be requested with an HTTP GET method.

All safe methods are also idempotent as well as some, but not all, unsafe methods like PUT, or DELETE."">safe</a> methods are also idempotent.</p>

<p>To be idempotent, only the actual back-end state of the server is considered, the status code returned by each request may differ: the first call of a <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE"" title=""The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.""><code>DELETE</code></a> will likely return a <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200"" title=""The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default.""><code>200</code></a>, while successive ones will likely return a <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404"" title=""The HTTP 404 Not Found client error response code indicates that the server can't find the requested resource. Links which lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links, and can be subject to link rot.""><code>404</code></a>. Another implication of <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE"" title=""The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.""><code>DELETE</code></a> being idempotent is that developers should not implement RESTful APIs with a <em>delete last entry</em> functionality using the <code>DELETE</code> method.</p>

<p>Note that the idempotence of a method is not guaranteed by the server and some applications may incorrectly break the idempotence constraint.</p>

<p><code>GET /pageX HTTP/1.1</code> is idempotent. Called several times in a row, the client gets the same results:</p>

<pre>GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p><code>POST /add_row HTTP/1.1</code> is not idempotent; if it is called several times, it adds several rows:</p>

<pre>POST /add_row HTTP/1.1
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Adds a 2nd row
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Adds a 3rd row
</pre>

<p><code>DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1</code> is idempotent, even if the returned status code may change between requests:</p>

<pre>DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 200 if idX exists
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 404 as it just got deleted
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 404</pre>

IDL (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>An <strong>IDL</strong> (<em>Interface Description Language</em>) is a generic language used to specified objects' interfaces apart from any specific programming language.</p>

<h2 id=""Content_versus_IDL_attributes"">Content versus IDL attributes</h2>

<p>In HTML, most attributes have two faces: the <strong>content attribute</strong> and the <strong>IDL (Interface Definition Language) attribute</strong>.</p>

<p>The content attribute is the attribute as you set it from the content (the HTML code) and you can set it or get it via <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute"" title=""Sets the value of an attribute on the specified element. If the attribute already exists, the value is updated; otherwise a new attribute is added with the specified name and value.""><code>element.setAttribute()</code></a> or <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAttribute"" title=""The getAttribute() method of the Element interface returns the value of a specified attribute on the element.""><code>element.getAttribute()</code></a>. The content attribute is always a string even when the expected value should be an integer. For example, to set an <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"" title=""The HTML &lt;input&gt; element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. ""><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a> element's <code>maxlength</code> to 42 using the content attribute, you have to call <code>setAttribute(""maxlength"", ""42"")</code> on that element.</p>

<p>The IDL attribute is also known as a JavaScript property. These are the attributes you can read or set using JavaScript properties like <code class=""moz-txt-verticalline"">element.foo</code>. The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it. In other words, the IDL attributes, in essence, reflect the content attributes.</p>

<p>Most of the time, IDL attributes will return their values as they are really used. For example, the default <code>type</code> for <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input"" title=""The HTML &lt;input&gt; element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. ""><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a> elements is ""text"", so if you set <code>input.type=""foobar""</code>, the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element will be of type text (in the appearance and the behavior) but the ""type"" content attribute's value will be ""foobar"". However, the <code>type</code> IDL attribute will return the string ""text"".</p>

<p>IDL attributes are not always strings; for example, <code>input.maxlength</code> is a number (a signed long). When using IDL attributes, you read or set values of the desired type, so <code>input.maxlength</code> is always going to return a number and when you set <code>input.maxlength</code> ,it wants a number. If you pass another type, it is automatically converted to a number as specified by the standard JavaScript rules for type conversion.</p>

<p>IDL attributes can <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes"" rel=""noopener"">reflect other types</a> such as unsigned long, URLs, booleans, etc. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules and the way IDL attributes behave in conjunction with their corresponding content attributes depends on the attribute. Most of the time, it will follow <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes"" rel=""noopener"">the rules laid out in the specification</a>, but sometimes it doesn't. HTML specifications try to make this as developer-friendly as possible, but for various reasons (mostly historical), some attributes behave oddly (<code>select.size</code>, for example) and you should read the specifications to understand how exactly they behave.</p>

Intrinsic Size (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>In CSS, the <em>intrinsic size</em> of an element is the size it would be based on its content, if no external factors were applied to it.

<p>How intrinsic sizes are calculated is defined in the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-sizes"" rel=""noopener"">CSS Intrinsic and Extrinsic Sizing Specification</a>.</p>

<p>Intrinsic sizing takes into account the <code>min-content</code> and <code>max-content</code> size of an element. For text the <code>min-content</code> size would be if the text wrapped as small as it can in the inline direction without causing an overflow, doing as much soft-wrapping as possible.

<h2 id=""Origins_and_History"">Origins and History</h2>

<p>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Microsoft_Internet_Explorer"" title=""Internet Explorer 3.0: Internet Explorer (or IE) is a free graphical browser maintained by Microsoft for legacy enterprise uses.

<p>In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (tenth, ES2019) edition is available in June 2019.</p>

<p>JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, <code>null</code>, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects).  JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on.  (Date objects by default serialize to a string containing the date in ISO format, so the information isn't completely lost.) If you need JSON to represent additional data types, transform values as they are serialized or before they are deserialized.</p>

<p>Much like XML, JSON has the ability to store hierarchical data unlike the more traditional CSV format.  Many tools provide translation between these formats such as this online <a class=""external"" href=""https://json-csv.com"" rel=""noopener"">JSON to CSV Converter</a> or this alternative <a class=""external"" href=""https://jsontoexcel.com"" rel=""noopener"">JSON to CSV Converter</a>.</p>

lossy compression (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><strong>Lossy compression</strong>, or irreversible compression, is a data-compression method that uses inexact approximations and partial-data discarding to represent content. In simpler terms: lossy compression causes data from the initial file to be lost, possibly causing degradation in quality. The process of such compression is irreversible; once lossy compression of the content has been performed, the content cannot be restored to its original state. Therefore, content that has undergone lossy compression should generally not be further edited.</p>

<p>Lossy compression is widely used in image formats.</p>

MitM (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>Man-in-the-middle attack</strong> (MitM) intercepts a communication between two systems. For example, a Wi-Fi router can be compromised.</p>

<p>Comparing this to physical mail: If you're writing letters to each other, the mailman can intercept each letter you mail. They open it, read it, eventually modify it, and then repackage the letter and only then send it to whom you intended to sent the letter for. The original recipient would then mail you a letter back, and the mailman would again open the letter, read it, eventually modify it, repackage it, and give it to you. You wouldn't know there's a man in the middle in your communication channel – the mailman is invisible to you and to your recipient.</p>

<p>In physical mail and in online communication, MITM attacks are tough to defend. A few tips:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Don't just ignore certificate warnings. You could be connecting to a phishing server or an imposter server.</li>
 <li>Sensitive sites without HTTPS encryption on public Wi-Fi networks aren't trustworthy.</li>
 <li>Check for HTTPS in your address bar and ensure encryption is in-place before logging in.</li>

MVC (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><strong>MVC</strong> (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software’s business logic and display. This ""separation of concerns"" provides for a better division of labor and improved <span>maintenance</span>. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).</p>

<p>The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Model: Manages data and business logic.</li>
 <li>View: Handles layout and display.</li>
 <li>Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=""Model_View_Controller_example"">Model View Controller example</h2>

<p>Imagine a simple shopping list app. All we want is a list of the name, quantity and price of each item we need to buy this week. Below we'll describe how we could implement some of this functionality using MVC.</p>

<p><img alt=""Diagram to show the different parts of the mvc architecture."" src=""https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16042/model-view-controller-light-blue.png"" style=""height: 1500px; width: 2000px;""/></p>

<h3 id=""The_Model"">The Model</h3>

<p>The model defines what data the app should contain. If the state of this data changes, then the model will usually notify the view (so the display can change as needed) and sometimes the controller (if different logic is needed to control the updated view).</p>

<p>Going back to our shopping list app, the model would specify what data the list items should contain — item, price, etc. — and what list items are already present.</p>

<h3 id=""The_View"">The View</h3>

<p>The view defines how the app's data should be displayed.</p>

<p>In our shopping list app, the view would define how the list is presented to the user, and receive the data to display from the model.</p>

<h3 id=""The_Controller"">The Controller</h3>

<p>The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.</p>

<p>So for example, our shopping list could have input forms and buttons that allow us to add or delete items. These actions require the model to be updated, so the input is sent to the controller, which then manipulates the model as appropriate, which then sends updated data to the view.</p>

<p>You might however also want to just update the view to display the data in a different format, e.g., change the item order to alphabetical, or lowest to highest price. In this case the controller could handle this directly without needing to update the model.</p>

<h2 id=""MVC_on_the_web"">MVC on the web</h2>

<p>As a web developer, this pattern will probably be quite familiar even if you've never consciously used it before. Your data model is probably contained in some kind of database (be it a traditional server-side database like MySQL, or a client-side solution such as <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"">IndexedDB [en-US]</a>.) Your app's controlling code is probably written in HTML/JavaScript, and your user interface is probably written using HTML/CSS/whatever else you like. This sounds very much like MVC, but MVC makes these components follow a more rigid pattern.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web, MVC architecture was mostly implemented on the server-side, with the client requesting updates via forms or links, and receiving updated views back to display in the browser. However, these days, more of the logic is pushed to the client with the advent of client-side data stores, and XMLHttpRequest allowing partial page updates as required.</p>

<p>Web frameworks such as <a class=""external"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS"" rel=""noopener"" title=""AngularJS"">AngularJS</a> and <a class=""external"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js"" rel=""noopener"" title=""Ember.js"">Ember.js</a> all implement an MVC architecture, albeit in slightly different ways.</p>

<p>For example, NaNs can represent infinity, result of division by zero, missing value, or the square root of a negative (which is imaginary, whereas a floating-point number is real).</p>

<p>Practically speaking, if I divide two variables in a <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a> program, the result may be NaN, which is predefined in JavaScript as ""undefined"". Hence this division may break the program. Now, if this computation was a small part of a much larger algorithm, it would be really painful to figure out where the error actually occurs. Fortunately, since the result will be NaN and I know my divisor may turn out to be 0, I can set up testing conditions that prevent any such computations in the first place or notify me of where they happen.</p>

Network throttling (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p class=""seoSummary""><strong>Network throttling </strong> is an intentional slowing down of internet speed. In web performance, network throttling, or network condition emulation, it is used to emulate low bandwidth conditions experienced by likely a large segment of a site's target user base.</p>

<p>It’s important not to overlook network conditions users experience on mobile. The internet speeds for developers creating web applications in a corporate office building on a powerful computer are generally very fast. As a developer, tech writer, or designer, this is likely your experience. The network speeds of a mobile user accessing that web application, possibly while traveling or in a remote area with poor data plan covereage, will likely be very slow, if they are able to get online at all. Network throttling enables a developer to emulate an experience of a user. Most browser developer tools, such as the browser inspector, provide a function to emulate different network conditions. By emulating your user's experience via network throttling, you can more readily identify and fix load time issues.</p>

<p>In a browser's developer tools, under the network panel, there is generally a drop down list with network speed options including wifi, good 3G, 2G, etc., with a default value of ""no throttling"".  You can even test 'offline'.</p>

Packet (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. The maincomponents of a network packet are the user data and control information. The user data is known as the <em>payload</em>. The control information is the information for delivering the payload. It consists of network addresses for the source and destination, sequencing information, and error detection codes and is generally found in packet headers and footer.</p>

<p>A packet contains:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <h5 id=""Hop_limit"">Hop limit</h5>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 <p>A hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network to the next network. It is a field that is decreases by one each time a packet goes through, once it reaches 0 it has failed and the packet is discarded. </p>

 <p>Over time the number packets can cause traversing within closed circuits, the number of pa ckets circulating would build up and then ultimately lead to the networking in failing.</p>
 </dd>

<dl>
 <dt>
 <h5 id=""Error_detection_and_correction"">Error detection and correction</h5>
 </dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Error detection and correction are codes that are used to detect and apply corrections to the errors that occur when data is transmitted to the receiver. There are two types of error corrections backward and forward error correction. Backward error correction is when the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the entire data unit. Forward error correction is when the  receiver uses the error-correcting code which automatically corrects the errors</p>

 <p>At the transmitter, the calculation is performed before the packet is sent. When received at the destination, the checksum is recalculated, and compared with the one in the packet.</p>

Page prediction (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><strong>Page Prediction</strong> is a browser feature or script which, when enabled, tells the browser to download resources the user is likely to visit before any user requests for the content are made. Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not request.</p>

<p>Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLS based on browsing history and/or related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request.</p>

<p>While browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, badwidth may be wasted and websites and any embedded content that are pre-loaded may set and read their own cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't.</p>

Parse (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run, for example the <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a> engine inside browsers.</p>

<p>The <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_Parser"">browser parses HTML</a> into a <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM"" title=""DOM: The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment)."">DOM</a> tree. HTML parsing involves <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList"">tokenization</a> and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.</p>

<p>When the HTML parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags—particularly those without an <code><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"">async</a></code> or <code>defer</code> attribute—blocks rendering, and pauses parsing of HTML.</p>

<p>When the browser encounters CSS styles, it parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM"" title=""CSSOM: The CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is a map of all CSS selectors and relevant properties for each selector in the form of tree, with root node, sibling, descendant, child and other relationship.

Perceived performance (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p class=""seoSummary""><strong>Perceived performance</strong> is a subjective measure of how fast a website seems to a user based on load time and site responsiveness. This measure relies on human perception, not an objective metric like <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive"">time to interactive.</a></p>

<p>In terms of web performance, perceived performance is how fast a user interaction feels rather than how fast an interaction actually is, be that a button press or a page load. Perceived performance is not how fast your site is; it's how fast your users <em>think</em> it is. Perceived performance is not measured by when your site is done loading but when it has loaded enough for users to <em>believe</em> it has loaded and is interactive. In terms of conversion rates, perceived performance is more important than the actual load and response times.</p>

<p><a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Speed_index"">Speed Index</a> is a common metric for measuring perceived performance, though it's not perfect. Other features, such as good UX design, including animations, and <a href=""/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/Lazy_loading"">lazy loading</a>, can make your site appear more responsive, even if the download and response times remain the same.</p>

<p>Actual performance is a measurement from when a request is made, through the downloading, parsing and execution of all resources, and the final paint. While increased performance generally increases perceived performance, there are some techniques that can be used to increase perceived performance while marginally decreasing actual performance.</p>

<p>There are front end optimization techniques that can improve perceived performance, such as adding the <code>defer</code> or <code>async</code> attribute to scripts, or placing scripts at the end of documents, and placing CSS in the head of documents.</p>

Polyfill (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.</p>

<p>For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 using a Silverlight plugin or mimic support for CSS rem units, or <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow"" title=""The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations.""><code>text-shadow</code></a>, or whatever you want.</p>

<p>The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. For example, the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#Polyfill"">Object.create polyfill</a> only contains the functionalities that are possible in a non-native implementation of Object.create.</p>

<p>Other times, polyfills are used to address issues where browsers implement the same features in different ways. The polyfill uses non-standard features in a certain browser to give JavaScript a standards-compliant way to access the feature. Although this reason for polyfilling is very rare today, it was especially prevalent back in the days of IE6, Netscape, and NNav where each browser implemented Javascript very differently. The <a class=""external"" href=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.js"" rel=""noopener"">1st version of JQuery</a> was an early example of a polyfill. It was essentially a compilation of browser-specific workarounds so that JavaScript developers could have a single common API that worked in all browsers. At the time, JavaScript developers were grasping at straws trying to get their website to work across all devices because there was such a discrepancy between browsers that the website might have to be programmed radically differently and have a much different user interface based upon the user's browser. Thus, the JavaScript developer had access to only a very tiny handful of JavaScript APIs that worked more-or-less consistently across all browsers. Using a polyfill to handle browser-specific implementations is practically non-existent today because modern browsers mostly implement a broad set of APIs according to standard semantics.</p>

Primitive (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary"">In <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"">JavaScript</a>, a <strong>primitive</strong> (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/object"">object</a> and has no <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/method"">methods</a>. There are 6 primitive data types: <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/string"">string</a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/number"">number</a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/bigint"">bigint</a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/boolean"">boolean</a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/undefined"">undefined</a>, and <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/symbol"">symbol</a>.

<p>Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.</p>

<p>All primitives are <strong>immutable</strong>, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.</p>

<h2 id=""Example"">Example</h2>

<p>This example will help you understand the fact that primitive values are <strong>immutable.</strong></p>

<h3 id=""JavaScript"">JavaScript</h3>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// Using a string method doesn't mutate the string
var bar = ""baz"";
console.log(bar);               // baz
bar.toUpperCase();
console.log(bar);               // baz

// Using an array method mutates the array
var foo = [];
console.log(foo);               // []
foo.push(""plugh"");
console.log(foo);               // [""plugh""]

// Assignment gives the primitive a new (not a mutated) value
bar = bar.toUpperCase();       // BAZ
</pre>

<p>A primitive can be replaced, but it can't be directly altered.</p>

<h2 id=""Another_Example_Step-by-step"">Another Example [ Step-by-step ]</h2>

<p>The following example will help you go through how JavaScript deals with Primitives.</p>

<h3 class=""highlight-spanned"" id=""JavaScript_2""><span class=""highlight-span"">JavaScript</span></h3>

<pre class=""brush: js line-numbers language-js"">// The Primitive
let foo = 5;

// Defining a function that should change the Primitive value
function addTwo(num) {
   num += 2;
}
// Another function trying to do the same thing
function addTwo_v2(foo) {
   foo += 2;
}

// Calling our first function while passing our Primitive as an argument
addTwo(foo);
// Getting the current Primitive value
console.log(foo);   // 5

// Trying again with our second function...
addTwo_v2(foo);
console.log(foo);   // 5
</pre>

<p>Did you expect it to be <code>7</code> instead of <code>5</code>? If so, read how this code runs:</p>

<ul>
 <li>For both the <code>addTwo</code> and <code>addTwo_v2</code> functions calls, JavaScript looks up the value for the identifier <code>foo</code>. It correctly finds our variable instantiated with our first statement</li>
 <li>After finding it, the expression is evaluated, <code>foo</code> is replaced by 5 and the JavaScript engine passes that value to the functions as an argument</li>
 <li>Before executing the statements inside the functions' bodies, <strong>JavaScript takes a copy of the original passed argument</strong> (which is a primitive) and creates a local copy. These copies, existing only inside the functions' scopes, are accessible via the identifiers we specified in the functions' definitions (<code>num</code> for <code>addTwo</code>, <code>foo</code> for <code>addTwo_v2</code>)</li>
 <li>Then, the functions' statements are executed:
  <ul>
   <li>In the first function, a local <code>num</code> variable had been created. We are increasing its value by 2, not the original <code>foo</code>'s value!</li>
   <li>In the second function, a local <code>foo</code> variable had been created. We are increasing its value by 2, not the original (external) <code>foo</code>'s value! Also, in this situation, the external <code>foo</code> variable cannot be accessed directly. This is because of JavaScript's lexical scoping and the resulting variable shadowing. The local <code>foo</code> hides the external <code>foo</code>. For more information, see <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures"">Closures</a>. (Note that <code>window.foo</code> could still be used to access the external <code>foo</code> variable.)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>In conclusion, any changes inside our functions <strong>won't</strong> affect the ORIGINAL <code>foo</code> at all, as we are working on our <strong>copies</strong> of it</li>
</ul>

<p>That's why Primitives are immutable - instead of working on them directly, we're working on a <em>copy, without affecting the original</em>.</p>

<h2 id=""Primitive_wrapper_objects_in_JavaScript"">Primitive wrapper objects in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Except for <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, all primitive values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String""><code>String</code></a> for the string primitive.</li>

<p>Special notice should be taken of accessibility — acceptable alternatives should be provided where possible.</p>

<p>It is a useful technique that allows Web developers to focus on developing the best possible websites while balancing the issues in those websites being accessed by multiple unknown user-agents. <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation"" title=""Graceful degradation: Graceful degradation is a design philosophy that centers around trying to build a modern web site/application that will work in the newest browsers, but fall back to an experience that while not as good still delivers essential content and functionality in older browsers."">Graceful degradation</a> is related but different — often seen as going in the opposite direction to progressive enhancement. In reality both approaches are valid and can often complement one another.</p>

Proxy server (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>proxy server</strong> is an intermediate program or computer used when navigating through different networks of the Internet. They facilitate access to content on the World Wide Web. A proxy intercepts requests and serves back responses; it may forward the requests, or not (for example in the case of a cache), and it may modify it (for example changing its headers, at the boundary between two networks).</p>

<p>A proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's computer and a destination server on the Internet. In general there are two main types of proxy servers:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A <strong>forward proxy</strong> that handles requests from and to anywhere on the Internet.</li>
 <li>A<strong> reverse proxy </strong>taking requests from the Internet and forwarding them to servers in an internal network.</li>

Public-key cryptography (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Public-key cryptography — or <em>asymmetric cryptography</em> — is a cryptographic system in which keys come in pairs. The transformation performed by one of the keys can only be undone with the other key. One key (the <em>private key</em>) is kept secret while the other is made public.</p>

<p>When used for digital signatures, the private key is used to sign and the public key to verify. This means that anyone can verify a signature, but only the owner of the corresponding private key could have generated it.</p>

<p>When used for encryption, the public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt. This gives public-key encryption systems an advantage over symmetric encryption systems in that the encryption key can be made public. Anyone could encrypt a message to the owner of the private key, but only the owner of the private key could decrypt it. However, they are typically much slower than symmetric algorithms and the size of message they can encrypt is proportional to the size of the key, so they do not scale well for long messages.</p>

<p>As a result, it's common for an encryption system to use a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the message, then a public-key system to encrypt the symmetric key. This arrangement can confer the benefits of both systems.</p>

<p>Commonly used public-key cryptosystems are RSA (for both signing and encryption), DSA (for signing) and Diffie-Hellman (for key agreement).</p>

Quality values (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary""><strong>Quality values</strong>, or <em>q-values</em> and <em>q-factors</em>, are used to describe the order of priority of values in a comma-separated list. It is a special syntax allowed in some <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers"">HTTP headers</a> and in HTML.</span> The importance of a value is marked by the suffix <code>';q='</code> immediately followed by a value between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> included, with up to three decimal digits, the highest value denoting the highest priority. When not present, the default value is <code>1</code>.</p>

<h2 id=""Examples"">Examples</h2>

<p>The following syntax</p>

<pre><code>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8</code></pre>

   <td><code>0.9</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>*/*</code></td>
   <td><code>0.8</code></td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p>If there is no priority defined for the first two values, the order in the list is irrelevant. Nevertheless, with the same quality, more specific values have priority over less specific ones:</p>

<p>PRNGs can be used for a variety of applications, such as games.</p>

<p>A cryptographically secure PRNG is a PRNG with certain extra properties making it suitable for use in cryptography. These include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>that it's computationally unfeasible for an attacker (without knowledge of the seed) to predict its output</li>
 <li>that if an attacker can work out its current state, this should not enable the attacker to work out previously emitted numbers.</li>

<p>Because <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP"" title=""HTTP: The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them.

Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.</p>

RGB (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Red Green Blue (RGB) is a color model that represents colors as mixtures of three underlying components (or channels), namely, red, green, and blue. Each color is described by a sequence of three numbers (typically between 0.0 and 1.0, or between 0 and 255) that represent the different intensities (or contributions) of red, green, and blue, in determining the final color.</p>

<p>There are many ways to describe the RGB components of a color. In <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS"" title=""CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser."">CSS</a> they can be represented as a single 24-bit integer in hexadecimal notation (for example, <code>#</code><code>add</code>8e6 is light blue), or in functional notation as three separate 8-bit integers (for example, rgb(46, 139, 87) is sea green). In <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/OpenGL"" title=""OpenGL: OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

Graphically, a color can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional grid or cube, where each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel.</p>

Safe (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>An HTTP method is <strong>safe</strong> if it doesn't alter the state of the server. In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"" title=""The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.""><code>GET</code></a>, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD"" title=""The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that are returned if the specified resource would be requested with an HTTP GET method. Such a request can be done before deciding to download a large resource to save bandwidth, for example.""><code>HEAD</code></a>, or <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS"" title=""The HTTP OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource. The client can specify a URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server.""><code>OPTIONS</code></a>. All safe methods are also <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/idempotent"">idempotent</a>, but not all idempotent methods are safe. For example, <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT"" title=""The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.""><code>PUT</code></a> and <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE"" title=""The HTTP DELETE request method deletes the specified resource.""><code>DELETE</code></a> are both idempotent but unsafe.</p>

<p>Even if safe methods have a read-only semantic, servers can alter their state: e.g. they can log or keep statistics. What is important here is that by calling a safe method, the client doesn't request any server change itself, and therefore won't create an unnecessary load or burden for the server. Browsers can call safe methods without fearing to cause any harm to the server; this allows them to perform activities like pre-fetching without risk. Web crawlers also rely on calling safe methods.</p>

<p>Safe methods don't need to serve static files only; a server can generate an answer to a safe method on-the-fly, as long as the generating script guarantees safety: it should not trigger external effects, like triggering an order in an e-commerce Web site.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the application on the server to implement the safe semantic correctly, the webserver itself, being Apache, Nginx or IIS, can't enforce it by itself. In particular, an application should not allow <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET"" title=""The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.""><code>GET</code></a> requests to alter its state.</p>

<p>A call to a safe method, not changing the state for the server:</p>

<pre>GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p>A call to a non-safe method, that may change the state of the server:</p>

<pre>POST /pageX.html HTTP/1.1 </pre>

<p>A call to an idempotent but non-safe method:</p>

<pre>DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1</pre>

You can also toggle VoiceOver on and off with fn+command + F5. VoiceOver both reads aloud and displays content. The content read aloud is displayed in a dark grey box.</p>

<p>Desktop/laptop screen reader users navigate websites with a keyboard or other non-pointing device. The best way to emulate use is to do the same.</p>

<p>Just like keyboard navigation without VoiceOver, you can navigate through interactive elements using the tab key and the arrow keys:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Next interactive element: Tab</li>
 <li>Previous interactive element: Shift + Tab</li>
 <li>Next radio button in a same named-group: right or down arrow</li>
 <li>Previous radio button in a same named-group: left or up arrow</li>
</ul>

<p>Navigating through the content of a page is done with the tab key and a series of other keys along with Control + Option keys</p>

<ul>
 <li>Next heading: Control + Option + H</li>
 <li>Next list: Control + Option + X</li>
 <li>Next graphic: Control + Option + G</li>
 <li>Next table: Control + Option + T</li>
 <li>Down an HTML hierarchical order Control + Option + right arrow</li>
 <li>Previous heading: Shift + Control + Option + H</li>
 <li>Previous list: Shift + Control + Option + X</li>
 <li>Previous graphic: Shift + Control + Option + G</li>
 <li>Previous table: Shift + Control + Option + T</li>
 <li>Up an HTML hierarchical order: Control + Option + left arrow</li>

Selector (CSS) (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>CSS selector</strong> is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them.</p>

<div id=""glossary-selector-details"">
<p>Consider this CSS:</p>

<pre class=""brush: css"">p {
  color: green;
}

div.warning {
  width: 100%;
  border: 2px solid yellow;
  color: white;
  background-color: darkred;
  padding: 0.8em 0.8em 0.6em;
}

#customized {
  font: 16px Lucida Grande, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
</pre>

<p>The selectors here are <code>""p""</code> (which applies the color green to the text inside any <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"" title=""The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph.""><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> element), <code>""div.warning""</code> (which makes any <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"" title=""The HTML Content Division element (&lt;div&gt;) is the generic container for flow content.

<p>We can then apply this CSS to some HTML, such as:</p>

<pre class=""brush: html"">&lt;p&gt;This is happy text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=""warning""&gt;
  Be careful! There are wizards present, and they are quick to anger!

Semantics (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary"">In programming, <strong>Semantics</strong> refers to the <em>meaning</em> of a piece of code — for example ""what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?"", or ""what purpose or role does that HTML element have"" (rather than ""what does it look like?"".)</span></p>

<h2 id=""Semantics_in_JavaScript"">Semantics in JavaScript</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li"" title=""The HTML &lt;li&gt; element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (&lt;ol&gt;), an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;), or a menu (&lt;menu&gt;). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.""><code>&lt;li&gt;</code></a> element with that string as its <code>textContent</code>. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called <code>build('Peach')</code>, or <code>createLiWithContent('Peach')</code>?</p>

<h2 id=""Semantics_in_CSS"">Semantics in CSS</h2>

<p>In CSS, consider styling a list with <code>li</code> elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with <code>div &gt; ul &gt; li</code>, or <code>.fruits__item</code>?</p>

<h2 id=""Semantics_in_HTML"">Semantics in HTML</h2>

<p>In HTML, for example, the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1"" title=""REDIRECT Heading elements [en-US]""><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of ""a top level heading on your page.""</p>

<pre class=""brush: html"">&lt;h1&gt;This is a top level heading&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>

<p>By default, most browser's <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#User-agent_stylesheets"">user agent stylesheet</a> will style an <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1"" title=""REDIRECT Heading elements [en-US]""><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> with a large font size to make it <em>look </em>like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could make any element <em>look</em> like a top level heading. Consider the following:</p>

<pre class=""brush: html"">&lt;span style=""font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;""&gt;Is this a top level heading?&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.</p>

<p>HTML should be coded to represent the <em>data</em> that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"">CSS</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO"" title=""SEO: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings."">SEO</a>)</li>
 <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
 <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching though endless <code>div</code>s with or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
 <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
 <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
</ul>

<p>When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, ""What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?"" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.</p>

<p>A domain name is not limited to a TLD and an SLD.

Speculative parsing (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Traditionally in browsers the HTML parser ran on the main thread and was blocked after a <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag until the script has been retrieved from the network and executed. Some HTML parser, such as Firefox since Firefox 4, support speculative parsing off of the main thread. It parses ahead while scripts are being downloaded and executed. The HTML parser starts speculative loads for scripts, style sheets and images it finds ahead in the stream and runs the HTML tree construction algorithm speculatively. The upside is that when a speculation succeeds, there's no need to reparse the part of the incoming file that was already scanned for scripts, style sheets and images. The downside is that there's more work lost when the speculation fails.</p>

<p>This document helps you avoid the kind of things that make speculation fail and slow down the loading of your page.</p>

<p>To make speculative loads of linked scripts, style sheets and images successful, avoid <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write"" title=""The Document.write() method writes a string of text to a document stream opened by document.open().""><code>document.write</code></a>. If you use a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element to override the base URI of your page, put the element in the non-scripted part of the document. Don't add it via <code>document.write()</code> or <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement"" title=""In an HTML document, the document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, or an HTMLUnknownElement if tagName isn't recognized.""><code>document.createElement</code></a>.</p>



<h2 id=""Avoiding_losing_tree_builder_output"">Avoiding losing tree builder output</h2>

<p>Speculative tree building fails when <code>document.write()</code> changes the tree builder state such that the speculative state after the <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag no longer holds when all the content inserted by <code>document.write()</code> has been parsed. However, only unusual uses of <code>document.write()</code> cause trouble. Here are the things to avoid:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Don't write unbalanced trees. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;div&gt;"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> is bad. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> is OK.</li>
 <li>Don't write an unfinished token. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> is bad.</li>
 <li>Don't finish your writing with a carriage return. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""Hello World!\r"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> is bad. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""Hello World!\n"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> is OK.</li>
 <li>Note that writing balanced tags may cause other tags to be inferred in a way that makes the write unbalanced. E.g. <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> inside the <code>head</code> element will be interpreted as <code>&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"");&lt;/script&gt;</code> which is unbalanced.</li>
 <li>Don't format part of a table. <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;script&gt;document.write(""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hello World!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"");&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code> is bad.</li>

SQL Injection (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>SQL injection takes advantage of Web apps that fail to validate user input. Hackers can maliciously pass SQL commands through the Web app for execution by a backend database.</p>

<p>SQL injection can gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. Many data breaches are due to SQL injection.</p>

<p><a class=""external"" href=""http://www.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/sql_inj_xss.gif"" rel=""noopener""><img alt="""" src=""http://www.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/sql_inj_xss.gif""/></a></p>

<h2 id=""How_It_Works"">How It Works</h2>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.infosemantics.com.au/sites/default/files/image/widget_tutorials/Updates_LoginScreen.png"" style=""height: 309px; width: 293px;""/></p>

<p>After entering username and password, behind the GUI the SQL queries work as follows:</p>

<pre style=""margin-left: 0px;""><strong><span style=""color: #0000cd;"">""SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' "" + txt.User.Text+"" ' AND Password=' ""+ txt.Password.Text+"" ' "";</span></strong></pre>

<p>Now suppose User enters the Username: admin and Password: passwd123, so after clicking on the Log in button, SQL query will run as follows:</p>

<pre><strong><span style=""color: #0000cd;"">""SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' passwd123 ' "";</span>

</strong></pre>

<p>If the credentials are correct, then the user is allowed to log in, so it's a very simple (and therefore insecure) mechanism. Hackers use this insecurity to gain unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Hackers use a simple string called a Magical String, for example:</p>

<p><strong>Username: <em>admin</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Password: <em>anything 'or'1'='1</em></strong></p>

<p>After clicking on the login button, the SQL query will work as follows:</p>

<pre><strong><span style=""color: #0000cd;"">""SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 ' "";</span>
</strong></pre>

<p>Just take a closer look at the above query's password section.</p>

<pre><strong>Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 '</strong></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>The password is not 'anything', hence password=anything results in FALSE, but '1'='1' is a TRUE statement and hence returns a TRUE value. Finally, due to the OR operator, the value ( FALSE OR TRUE ) is TRUE, so authentication bypasses successfully. Just due to a simple string (Magical String) the entire database is compromised.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id=""How_To_Prevent"">How To Prevent</h2>

<p style=""margin-left: 40px;"">Before executing the queries for the user credentials, make some changes like the following:</p>

<pre><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">$id = $_GET['id'] </span>

<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">(1) $id = Stripslashes($id)</span>

<span style=""color: #0000ff;"">(2) $id = mysql_real_escape_String($id)</span></pre>

<p>So due to (1) each single quote (') in the input string is replaced with double quotes (""), and due to (2) before every (') it adds (/). The revised magical string fails to bypass the authentication, and your database stays secure.</p>

Style origin (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>In <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS"">CSS</a>, there are three categories of sources for style changes. These categories are called <strong>style origins</strong>. They are the <strong>user agent origin</strong>, <strong>user origin</strong>, and the <strong>author origin</strong>.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>User-agent origin</dt>
 <dd>The user agent origin is the style origin comprised of the default styles used by the user's web browser. If no other styles are applied to content, the user agent origin's styles are used while rendering elements.</dd>
 <dt> User origin</dt>
 <dd>The user origin is the style origin containing any CSS that the user of the web browser has added. These may be from adding styles using a developer tool or from a browser extension that automatically applies custom styles to content, such as <a class=""external"" href=""https://add0n.com/stylus.html"" rel=""noopener"">Stylus</a> or <a class=""external"" href=""https://userstyles.org/"" rel=""noopener"">Stylish</a>.</dd>
 <dt> Author origin</dt>
 <dd>The author origin is the style origin which contains all of the styles which are part of the document, whether embedded within the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML"">HTML</a> or loaded from an external stylesheet file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The style origins are used to determine where to stop rolling back (or backtracking through) the cascade of styles that have been applied to an element when removing styles, such as when using the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unset"" title=""The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not.

Symbol (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>In <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"">JavaScript</a>, Symbol is a <a href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive"">primitive value</a>.</p>

<p>A value having the data type <strong>Symbol</strong> can be referred to as a ""Symbol value"".  In a JavaScript runtime environment, a symbol value is created by invoking the function <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol""><code>Symbol</code></a>, which dynamically produces an anonymous, unique value. A symbol may be used as an object property.</p>

<p>Symbol can have an optional description, but for debugging purposes only.</p>

<p>A <strong>Symbol</strong> value represents a unique identifier. For example:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">// Here are two symbols with the same description:
let Sym1 = Symbol(""Sym"")
let Sym2 = Symbol(""Sym"")

console.log(Sym1 === Sym2) // returns ""false""
// Symbols are guaranteed to be unique.
// Even if we create many symbols with the same description,
// they are different values.
</pre>

<div class=""blockIndicator note"">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are familiar with Ruby's (or another language) that also has a feature called <em>""symbols""</em>, please don’t be misguided. JavaScript symbols are different.</p>
</div>

<p><dfn>Symbol</dfn> type is a new feature in ECMAScript 2015. There is no ECMAScript 5 equivalent for Symbol.</p>

<p>In some programming languages, the symbol data type is referred to as an ""atom.""</p>

<h3 id=""Symbols_dont_Auto-Convert_to_strings"">Symbols don't ""Auto-Convert"" to strings</h3>

<p>Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can <code>alert</code> almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don’t auto-convert.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">let Sym = Symbol(""Sym"")
alert(Sym)  // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
</pre>

<p>That’s a ""language guard"" against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different, and should not occasionally convert one into another.</p>

<p>If you really want to show a symbol, we need to call <code>.toString()</code> on it.</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">let Sym = Symbol(""Sym"")
alert(Sym.toString())  // Symbol(Sym), now it works</pre>

<p>Or you can use the <code><var>symbol</var>.description</code> property to get its description:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">let _Sym = Symbol(""Sym"");

alert(_Sym.description); // Sym</pre>

<h3 id=""Well-known_symbols"">Well-known symbols</h3>

<p>The <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol""><code>Symbol</code></a> class has constants for so-called <dfn>well-known symbols</dfn>. These symbols let you configure how JS treats an object, by using them as property keys.</p>

<p>Examples of well-known symbols are: <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator""><code>Symbol.iterator</code></a> for array-like objects, or <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/search""><code>Symbol.search</code></a> for string objects.</p>

<p>They are listed in the specification in the <a class=""external"" href=""https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols"" rel=""noopener"">Well-known symbols</a> table:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>Symbol.hasInstance</code></li>
 <li><code>Symbol.isConcatSpreadable</code></li>
 <li><code>Symbol.iterator</code></li>
 <li><code>Symbol.toPrimitive</code></li>
 <li>…and so on.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""Global_symbol_registry"">Global symbol registry</h3>

<p>There is a global symbol registry holding all available symbols. The methods that access the registry are <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/for""><code>Symbol.for()</code></a> and <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/keyFor""><code>Symbol.keyFor()</code></a>; these mediate between the global symbol table (or ""registry"") and the run-time environment. The global symbol registry is mostly built by JavaScript's compiler infrastructure, and the global symbol registry's content is not available to JavaScript's run-time infrastructure, except through these reflective methods.</p>

<p>The method <code>Symbol.for(<var>tokenString</var>)</code> returns a symbol value from the registry, and <code>Symbol.keyFor(<var>symbolValue</var>)</code> returns a token string from the registry; each is the other's inverse, so the following is true:</p>

<pre class=""brush: js"">Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.for(""tokenString"")) === ""tokenString"" // true
</pre>

Symmetric-key cryptography (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Symmetric-key cryptography is a term used for cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for encryption and for decryption. The key is usually called a ""symmetric key"" or a ""secret key"".</p>

<p>Symmetric-key algorithms should be secure when used properly and are highly efficient, so they can be used to encrypt large amounts of data without having a negative effect on performance.</p>

<p>Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data one block at a time.

Synthetic monitoring (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><span class=""seoSummary""><strong>Synthetic monitoring</strong> involves monitoring the performance of a page in a 'laboratory' environment, typically with automation tooling in an environment that is as consistent as possible.</span> With a consistent baseline, synthetic monitoring is good for measuring the effects of code changes on performance.

It prevents the appearance of network congestion whose capabilities are initially unknown, and slowly increases the volume of information diffused until the network's maximum capacity is found.</p>

<p>To implement TCP slow start, the congestion window (<em>cwnd</em>) sets an upper limit on the amount of data a source can transmit over the network before receiving an acknowledgment (ACK). The slow start threshold (<em>ssthresh</em>) determines the (de)activation of slow start. When a new connection is made, cwnd is initialized to one TCP data or acknowledgment packet, and waits for an acknowledgement, or ACK. When that ACK is received, the congestion window is incremented until the <em>cwnd</em> is less than <em>ssthresh</em>. Slow start also terminates when congestion is experienced.</p>

<p>Congestion itself is a state that happens within a network layer when the message traffic is too busy it slows the network response time.

The connection has a limited capacity depending on hardware and network conditions. If the server sends too many packets too quickly, they will be dropped. Meaning, there will be no acknowledgement. The server registers this as missing ACKs. Congestion control algorithms use this flow of sent packets and ACKs to determine a send rate.</span></p>

Texel (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>A <strong>Texel</strong> is a single-pixel within a texture map, which is an image that gets used (in whole or in part) as the image presented on a polygon's surface within a 3D rendered image. It is not to be confused with pixel which is the unit of screen space. This is one of the main differences between Texel’s and pixels, pixels are image data. Texel components are made up of subjective data, therefore they can be an image as well as a depth map.</p>

<p>The process of mapping the appropriate Texel’s to their corresponding points on a polygon is called <strong>texture mapping</strong>, which is a stage of the process of rendering a 3D image for display. Texture mapping is typically done prior to lighting the scene; however, in WebGL, lighting is performed as part of the texture mapping process.</p>

<p>Textures are characterised by collections of Texel’s, as how images are characterised by collections of pixels. When texture mapping occurs the renderer maps Texel’s to the appropriate pixels.</p>

Thread (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Thread in computer science is the execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the same time. Each unit capable of executing code is called a <strong>thread</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong><a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/main_thread"" title=""main thread: The main thread is where a browser processes user events and paints. By default, the browser uses a single thread to run all the JavaScript in your page, as well as to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This means that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience."">main thread</a></strong> is the one used by the browser to handle user events, render and paint the display, and to run the majority of the code that comprises a typical web page or app. Because these things are all happening in one thread, a slow website or app script slows down the entire browser; worse, if a site or app script enters an infinite loop, the entire browser will hang. This results in a frustrating, sluggish (or worse) user experience.</p>

<p>However, modern <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a> offers ways to create additional threads, each executing independently while possibly communicating between one another. This is done using technologies such as <strong><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API"">web workers</a></strong>, which can be used to spin off a sub-program which runs concurrently with the main thread in a thread of its own. This allows slow, complex, or long-running tasks to be executed independently of the main thread, preserving the overall performance of the site or app—as well as that of the browser overall. This also allows individuals to take advantage of modern multi-core processors.</p>

<p>A special type of worker, called a <strong><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"">service worker</a></strong>, can be created which can be left behind by a site—with the user's permission—to run even when the user isn't currently using that site. This is used to create sites capable of notifying the user when things happen while they're not actively engaged with a site. Such as notifying a user they have received new email even though they're not currently logged into their mail service.</p>

<p>Overall it can be observed these threads within our operating system are extremely helpful. They help minimise the context switching time, enables more efficient communication and allows further use of the multiprocessor architecture.</p>

<p>All modern browsers support the TLS protocol, requiring the server to provide a valid <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/Digital_certificate"" title=""digital certificate: A digital certificate is a data file that binds a publicly known cryptographic key to an organization."">digital certificate</a> confirming its identity in order to establish a secure connection. It is possible for both the client and server to mutually authenticate each other, if both parties provide their own individual digital certificates.</p>

<div class=""blockIndicator note"">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support will be removed from all major browsers in early 2020; you'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward. From version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a <a class=""external"" href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-firefox-did-not-connect"" rel=""noopener"">Secure Connection Failed</a> error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions (<a class=""external"" href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606734"" rel=""noopener"" title=""FIXED: Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 by default"">bug 1606734</a>).</p>

And talking about <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures"">Structured Types</a>, the other part of JavaScript Type System we can say they are constructed using exactly that sort of constructor.</p>

<p>A value's data type also affects which operations are valid on that value. For example, an integer can be multiplied by an integer, but not by a string. This is also useful knowledge for comparsion between data types. And the same time comparsion between sturctured types is not so ""easy to make"" topic: even if last structure is the same, there might bee inherited structures inside of the <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain"">Prototype Chain</a>.</p>

<p>The compiler could have coerced the <code>5</code> into a number and returned a sum of <code>14</code>, but it did not.

Vendor Prefix (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>Browser vendors sometimes add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers can experiment with new ideas while—in theory—preventing their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process. Developers should wait to include the unprefixed property until browser behavior is standardized.</p>

<div class=""note"">
<p>Browser vendors are working to stop using vendor prefixes for experimental features. Web developers have been using them on production Web sites, despite their experimental nature. This has made it more difficult for browser vendors to ensure compatibility and to work on new features; it's also been harmful to smaller browsers who wind up forced to add other browsers' prefixes in order to load popular web sites.</p>

<p>Lately, the trend is to add experimental features behind user-controlled flags or preferences, and to create smaller specifications which can reach a stable state much more quickly.</p>
</div>

<h2 id=""CSS_prefixes"">CSS prefixes</h2>

<p>The major browsers use the following prefixes:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>-webkit-</code> (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers including Firefox for iOS; basically, any WebKit based browser)</li>
 <li><code>-moz-</code> (Firefox)</li>
 <li><code>-o-</code> (old pre-WebKit versions of Opera)</li>
 <li><code>-ms-</code> (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre><em>-webkit-</em>transition: all 4s ease;
<em>-moz-</em>transition: all 4s ease;
<em>-ms-</em>transition: all 4s ease;
<em>-o-</em>transition: all 4s ease;
transition: all 4s ease; </pre>

<h2 id=""API_prefixes"">API prefixes</h2>

<p>Historically, vendors have also used prefixes for experimental APIs. If an entire interface is experimental, then the interface's name is prefixed (but not the properties or methods within). If an experimental property or method is added to a standardized interface, then the individual method or property is prefixed.</p>

<h3 id=""Interface_prefixes"">Interface prefixes</h3>

<p>Prefixes for interface names are upper-cased:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>WebKit</code> (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit based browser)</li>
 <li><code>Moz</code> (Firefox)</li>
 <li><code>O</code> (Older, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)</li>
 <li><code>MS</code> (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""Property_and_method_prefixes"">Property and method prefixes</h3>

<p>The prefixes for properties and methods are lower-case:</p>

 <li><code>moz</code> (Firefox)</li>

Wrapper (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>In programming languages such as JavaScript, a wrapper is a function that is intended to call one or more other functions, sometimes purely for convenience, and sometimes adapting them to do a slightly different task in the process.</p>

<p>For example, SDK Libraries for AWS are examples of wrappers.</p>

XHTML (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"">HTML</a> can travel over the network to a browser either in HTML syntax or an <a href=""/en-US/docs/XML_introduction"">XML</a> syntax called XHTML.</p>

<h2 id=""HTML5_and_HTMLXHTML"">HTML5 and HTML/XHTML</h2>

<p>The <a href=""/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5"">HTML5</a> standard defines both these syntaxes.  The MIME type (sent in the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header) indicates the choice of syntax: for XHTML the MIME type will be  <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, otherwise <code>text/html</code>.</p>

<p>This example shows an HTML document and an XHTML document including the appropriate HTTP headers:</p>

<h3 id=""HTML_document"">HTML document</h3>

<pre class=""brush: html"">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<h2 id=""MIME_type_versus_DOCTYPE"">MIME type versus DOCTYPE</h2>

<p>Before HTML5, the two separate specifications defined the two syntaxes (<a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/"" hreflang=""en"" lang=""en"" rel=""noopener"" title=""The 'HTML 4.01 Specification' specification"">HTML 4.01 Specification</a> and <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1"" rel=""noopener"">XHTML 1.0 specification</a>). According to the XHTML1 standard,  you could use XHTML by declaring a special DOCTYPE. However, no browsers have ever implemented this, and the HTML5 standard has reversed the decision. <strong>If your page is sent as <code>text/html</code>, you are not using XHTML</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead, the proper MIME type must be present in the <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header. If you only put the MIME type into an HTML meta tag like <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=…&gt;</code>, it will be ignored and treated like <code>text/html</code>.</p>

<p>If you serve your pages as <code>text/html</code> and believe that you are writing XHTML, you may face several problems, as described in these articles:</p>

<p>Most browsers currently support XHTML, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer (since IE 9). (Internet Explorer 8 and older browsers instead show a download dialog box for unknown file types when they see an XHTML document with the correct XHTML MIME type.)</p>

<p>Also be aware that many popular <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript"" title=""JavaScript: JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js."">JavaScript</a> libraries and developer tools have limited or no support for XHTML.</p>

XInclude (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p><a class=""external"" href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#text-included-items"" rel=""noopener"">XML Inclusions (XInclude)</a> is a W3C Recommendation to allow inclusion of XML more different sources in a more convenient fashion than XML external entities. When used in conjunction with XPointer (Firefox supports a subset of it, and is used in the code sample below), XInclude can also target just specific portions of a document for inclusion. Firefox does not support it natively, but the following function aims to allow its use with documents passed into it.</p>

<h3 id=""Code_sample"" name=""Code_sample"">Code sample</h3>

<p>The following code aims to let &lt;xi:include&gt; and &lt;xi:fallback&gt; tags (the two elements in the language) with all of the attributes of &lt;xi:include&gt; be included in an XML document so as to be resolvable into a single XML document.</p>

<p>(Note that this has not been thoroughly tested for all circumstances and may not necessarily reflect the standard behavior completely.)</p>

<p>Note also that if you wish to allow xml:base, you will need the <a href=""/en/Code_snippets/xml/base_function"" title=""en/Code_snippets/xml/base_function"">xml:base function</a>, and the line beginning <code>var href = ...</code> should become:</p>

XLink (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>XLink is a W3C standard which is used to describe links between XML and XML or other documents. Some its behaviors are left to the implementation to determine how to handle.</p>

<p>Simple XLinks are ""supported"" in Firefox (at least in SVG and MathML), though they do not work as links if one loads a plain XML document with XLinks and attempts to click on the relevant points in the XML tree.</p>

<p>For those who may have found XLink 1.0 cumbersome for regular links, XLink 1.1 drops the need to specify <code>xlink:type=""simple""</code> for simple links.</p>

<p>XLink is used in <a href=""/en/SVG"" title=""en/SVG"">SVG</a>, <a href=""/en/MathML"" title=""en/MathML"">MathML</a>, and other important standards.</p>

XML (MDN Web Docs Glossary)|"<article id=""wikiArticle""><p>eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.</p>

<p>XML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-language—that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as <a class=""glossaryLink"" href=""/en-US/docs/Glossary/RSS"" title=""RSS: RSS (Really Simple Syndication) refers to several XML document formats designed for publishing site updates.

Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.</p>
